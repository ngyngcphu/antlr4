# Introduction
A grammar that reads in sequences of integers. The trick is that part of the input specifies how many integers to group together. We donâ€™t know until runtime how many integers to match.

## I. Grammar
```antlr
grammar Data;

top: group+;

group: INT sequence[$INT.int];

sequence[n]
    locals[i=0]: ({$i < $n}? INT {$i = $i + 1})*;    // match n integers

INT: [0-9]+;
WS: [ \t\n\r] -> skip;
```
## II. Build and test
- Build:
    ```
    antlr4py3 Data.g4
    ```
- Test:
    ```
    python3 test.py t.data
    ```
    - Input:
        ```
        2 9 10 3 1 2 3
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        (top (group 2 (sequence 9 10)) (group 3 (sequence 1 2 3)))
        ```
